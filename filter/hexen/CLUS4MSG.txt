Another Heresiarch, another victory. Unfort-
unately this castle was not where Korax was
hiding. You've found another portal that then
flings you into god knows where.

This new place, if it's even still Cronos, is
looking much less dapper, and a lot more mor-
bid. You can sense the unease of death and
agitiation all around you. You spot a fourth
visage of Korax's face in stone, and know he'll
be speaking to you at least once more.

That said, you also seem to feel a sense of
finality in this place. Maybe this is Korax's
actual hiding place. Will you finally end this
miserable charade of his, or does he have a
few final tricks for you?

You also realize, you still have yet to see
any other humans, alive, dead, friend or foe,
since your arrival on Cronos. You get the
feeling that's about to change...
