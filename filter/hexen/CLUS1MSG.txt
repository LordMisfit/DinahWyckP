Adjusting yourself to this 'Cronos' wasn't too annoying
at first, but you've noticed these new monsters are even
more tenacious than the ones you've dealt with back 
when dealing with D'Sparil.

This Korax character seems to be the second of the serpent
riders, who you now know are D'Sparil's more powerful 
brothers. This Cronos is like the world before you, overrun
with his minions, and you've seen no living sign of human 
life, though you can tell humans did once live in this 
world. Maybe they're gone, or in hiding...

After a confusing run through trials of fire, ice and steel,
you find yourself in the beige backdrop of a mountainous 
wasteland. More of Korax's creatures are in wait for you, 
as well as this weird building in the distance that just seems 
to mock your presence...
