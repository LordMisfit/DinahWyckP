With the fall of Korax and the three former "grandmasters",
you quickly rush into the portal to escape the possible
collapsing of his Dark Crucible. That was a bit too close!

When you come to, you find yourself in an dark and ominous
hallway, with only a few torches and a bright, unnatural
source of light to mark the way.

Looking to the dias ahead, you see something... peculiar in
the distance, and move forward to inspect it, nervousness
in your steps...
