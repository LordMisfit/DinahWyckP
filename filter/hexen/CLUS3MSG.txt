You know, the worst part about fighting that 'Heresiarch' isn't
the fight itself. It's knowing how to pronounce its name. It 
doesn't seem to roll easily off the tongue.

Moving past that, you now tumble forth again through the 
aether, passing into a new part of Cronos. A large, foreboding
castle is in the distance. And it seems unlike Castle Quaran-
tine, this place doesn't even put on the facade of having
good vibes.

Now you wonder just how much more Korax's power can muster
against you. It feels like you've gone over the hill at this
point. However, you note another stone image of Korax ahead
of you and expect another contact from the annoying fool soon.

Now you just have to move forward and deal with this place.
Maybe Korax is inside somewhere... Then again... maybe not?
