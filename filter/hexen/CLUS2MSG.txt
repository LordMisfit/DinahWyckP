What the blazes was that lich dragon thing?! It almost seemed 
to give you flashbacks to your battle with the GlobeMother
in Castle Quarantine, but that's not here or there.

You step through a newly discovered portal within the mocking
'hypostyle', and after being torn across space, you find your-
self in a lone room, hearing more droning chants around you.
Another stone visage of Korax awaits you. No doubt he'll be
making a call to you through it soon.

At least Korax finds you entertaining enough to even speak 
to, unlike his aloof younger brother D'Sparil. You only saw
him once, and that was when you smashed him through the dirt,
becoming cursed to wonder a few worlds before being dropped
off here on Cronos.

Still, Korax has to die, for not only the people of Cronos,
but for you to have a chance to get back home...
