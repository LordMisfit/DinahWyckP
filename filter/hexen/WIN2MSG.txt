You take a closer look at what you clearly have
identified as a white, ghostly orb, and while
you're not an expert magician, you feel a sort
of anxious energy from it.

This sphere must be some kind of source of
Korax's weird powers. He was manipulating the
very halls of his Dark Crucible to destroy
you, some kind of powers over 'Chaos'...

Despite knowing how potentially dangerous
this object is, you also realize in a way, you
can't just leave something like this behind,
unattended. Who knows if that third serpent
rider will come here, will have sensed Korax's
demise and come for revenge. If you have this
in your possession, you'll at least keep it
out of their hands, if not learn how to use
it...

You reach out and grasp the sphere with
hesitiation...
