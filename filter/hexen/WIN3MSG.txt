You suddenly receive a very disturbing vision...

You now suddenly know the remaining Serpent Rider's name is
'Eidolon', at least. However you now see a FOURTH being, one
whom looks very different from either Eidolon, Korax and
D'Sparil. A being seen standing ABOVE the three Serpent Riders
in not only power, but one who potentially embodies the 
very concept of CHAOS itself, the original creator of the
Chaos Sphere...

His name... is Erebus... the 'Agent of Chaos'. The creator,
father... master of the other three. Oh boy. Now you're
really concerned about the possible hornet's nest you just
seem to kick being forced to off D'Sparil and Korax...

Do the 'Powers That Be' you've been 'working for' want you
to find and destroy Erebus too?! W-wait, what is the Chaos
Sphere doing now?!
